# upo_navigation_macro_actions. 
A set of navigation macro-actions have been also implemented. This way, the navigation system is employed to perform different actions as reaching a simple goal, approaching a moving person, or walk side-by-side. A launch file to test the macro-actions is inside the launch directory.

New macro-actions will be added and explained soon.

The package is a **work in progress** used in research prototyping. Pull requests and/or issues are highly encouraged.
